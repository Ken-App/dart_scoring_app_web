This is a dart scoring app for the game 501
Every single dart finish for any possible finish is covered
This app helps you with your finishes, it guides you with animated dots showing you the best way to check out.
It's fully customisable with 82,042 pre-programmed finish combinations to choose from, take your pick!
Written in Flutter/Dart as my first Application. It was created mainly with the help of AI as an experiment to see if someone with a bit of knowlege of old school programming (VB6) could write a modern day App that is cross platform
Took me about 2 months work to complete.
